      "description": "Set up for the cable hip abduction by attaching an ankle strap (if one is not available, a single handle may suffice) to the low pulley of a cable pulley machine and set your desired weight on the stack. Attach the ankle strap to your left ankle and stand up straight with your feet close together with your right foot closest to the machine. You can use your right arm to hold onto the machine for stability. You are now in the staring position. Begin the movement by lifting your left leg straight out to your side as high as comfortably possible. This will lift the weight from the stack. Pause for a moment and then slowly lower your leg back to the starting position. Repeat for the desired amount of reps. Turn around, attach the the strap to your right ankle and then repeat with your right leg.",
      "tips": "Stand up straight and focus on moving only at the hip. Keep your torso as still as possible. You can eventually begin to increase the range of motion by standing further and further away from the machine. This will require a good deal of balance as you won't be able to hold onto the machine.",

      "tips": "Experiment with foot and pelvis position. Depending upon the shape of your hip, you may need a slightly more internal or external starting position to fully maximize the contraction. Similarly, be mindful of your pelvic position - don’t allow the back to arch as this will tip the hips forward and place the adductors under excessive stretch before the contraction which can affect force output. If you can’t seem to figure out how to change the position of your pelvis while seated, experiment with changing the position of the torso (i.e. lean forward or push your back into the pad).",

      "tips": "The most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it. Do not allow yourself to fall into hyperextension, keep tension through the abs. If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax. Foam rolling may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism. Don’t slump into the shoulder capsule, maintain an active upper body. If you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea. If you find a sensitive spot, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”.",

      "description": "The EZ bar preacher curl is a great exercise to isolate the biceps, while minimizing the strain on your wrists. Adjust the seat on the preacher bench so that your upper arms sit comfortably on the padding when seated. Load the desired weight on the barbell. Sit on the preacher bench and grip the EZ bar with your hands shoulder width apart using an underhand (palms facing up) grip. (note: You can use a wide or narrow grip on this exercise) Keeping your back straight and eyes facing forward, take the weight off the rack so that you're supporting it with your arms slightly bent. This is the starting position. Slowly bring the weight up until your forearms are at a right angle to the floor. Squeeze the bicep at the top of the movement, and then slowly lower it back to the starting position. Repeat for desired reps.",
      "tips": "Keep the motion slow and controlled throughout the set. Don't 'rest' at the top of the movement. Squeeze the biceps as hard as possible as your get the weight to the top. Use a wide grip to work the inner biceps and a close grip to work the outer biceps.",

Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off. Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows. Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest. Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",

In order to keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb. If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top. Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”. Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury. The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands. As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path. Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first. Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling. Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses. Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability. Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat in order to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production. Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press. The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum. Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you. Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift. Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back. Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis. Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” in order to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder. The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.

Slowly raise the dumbbell up as far as possible squeezing the forearm muscles at the top of the movement. Pause, and then slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position. Repeat for desired reps.",
      "tips": "A light weight should be used with proper technique. It doesn't take heavy weight to make this exercise effective. Keep the rep timing slow, and pause/squeeze the forearms for a count of two at the top of the movement for added intensity.

Stand up straight with a slight bend in your knees and your feet around shoulder width apart. This is your starting position. Keep your back as straight as possible and bend over at the waist lowering the dumbbells over the tops of you feet. Your knees should be kept stationary during the movement. Focus on the stretch in your hamstrings, and continue to lower the dumbbells down as far as your hamstrings will let you comfortably. Now engage the hamstrings and begin to raise the dumbbells straight back up. Your eyes should be facing up and your shoulders back. This will prevent your lower back from rounding. Squeeze up through the glutes and hamstrings until you're standing straight up. Repeat for desired reps.",
      "tips": "You must keep your eyes looking up at all times. As soon as you look down at the floor your back will round! The dumbbells need to stay close to your body throughout the set. The further the dumbbells are from your body the more strain is on your lower back. Focus on stretching the hamstrings out as you lower the dumbbells and contracting them as you raise back up. The greater the mind-muscle connection the more you'll get out of this exercise. It's best to have your knees slightly bent during the set but fixed (ie: bend them slightly but keep them locked in the same place throughout the set). During the descent, to protect your lower back, keep your weight back on the heels. Do not let your weight shift forward onto the toes. If you find the your weight on the toes when at the bottom position of the exercise, you are performing it incorrectly. Do not relax at the bottom of the movement. Keep your legs, back and abdominals tight as you begin the ascent. Keep the rep timing slow and control the weight, especially when lowering. Remember the focus is on stretch and contraction! One of the biggest mistakes people make when performing this exercise is bending over at the waist without moving the hips back. Instead of being supported by the large hamstring muscles, the weight is now placed almost entirely on the lower spine. Needless to say, this puts your back at great risk for injury. If you keep the weight close to your body your hips with naturally move back. Technique is so important with this exercise. If you're just starting out, stand with your side to a mirror with a very light weight and practice the movement. Once you get the technique nailed you'll be able to move up in weight and start building some killer hams and glutes!",

This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.

Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away. Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips. Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward. Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
      "tips": "You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly. The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights. In order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length. Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you. Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion. Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar. Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend. To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights. More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement. For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors. The knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies: The knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width. You will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient. If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.",

Reach down and grab the dumbbells with a neutral grip (palms facing inward) and drop your hips.Your hips should be in the best, most natural position for leverage so you may need to raise or lower them slightly. Make sure your eyes are looking ahead. Your body will follow your head so keep your head up and eyes forward!  Be sure to keep a straight back and never allow it to round. You are now in the starting position. Focus on standing up with the dumbbells - not pulling them from the floor, and lead with your head as you rise. Drive with your heals and explode upward (leading with your head) as you rise. As the dumbbells rise to knee level, thrust your hips forward and contract your back by bringing your shoulder blades back. Pause here for a moment and then reverse the movement by bending at the knees while slowly lowering the weight - keeping the dumbbells under strict control on the descent. Reset your stance if necessary and repeat for desired reps.",

Read and re-read the form tips presented in this guide and practice them with a moderate weight. Start the deadlift with the hips in a position of strength and maximal leverage. If you start the deadlift with your hips too high you will be at a mechanical disadvantage and will tax your lower back. Starting with your hips too low will also cause you to lose your leverage and power. If you start the deadlift while looking down, there is a good chance your hips will lift up causing you to lose form and lift with your lower back. This is a very common deadlift mistake. Think about exploding your head upward while trying to stand erect. The body will follow the head.

Stand in front of the bar with your feet around shoulder width apart and halfway under the loaded bar. Your toes should be pointed straight ahead or slightly outward. Do what is comfortable for you. Reach down and grab the bar with both hands using an overhand grip just outside of shoulder width. You can use an alternating grip (one over/one under) to help you lift more weight.

      "tips": "The most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it. Use your free hand to stabilize yourself while holding onto something. Do not allow yourself to fall into overextension, keep tension through the abs. If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax. Do not roll the front of the shoulder directly as this can cause irritation to the biceps tendon and anterior capsule. Performing SMR may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism. If you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea. If you find a sensitive spot, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”.",

      "muscle": ["quads", "calves", "glutes", "hamstring", "lower back"],
      "description": "Set up for the exercise by setting the barbell to just below shoulder height and loading the weight you want to use. Stand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart. Position the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn't, try adding some padding to the bar. Now take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability. You should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack. Keeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack. Take a small step back and stabilize yourself. Keeping your eyes facing forward slowly lower your body down. Don't lean forward as you come down. Your buttocks should come out and drop straight down. Squat down until your thighs are parallel with the floor, and then slowly raise your body back up by pushing through your heels. Do not lock the knees out when you stand up, and then repeat the movement.",
      "tips": "Rounding the lower back: It's crucially important that you keep a straight back when you squat! You can ensure your back is straight by keeping your eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place. Pushing from the balls of your feet: This puts unnecessary strain on joints and tendons. Always push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right. Leaning forward: This happens when your hips move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down. Knees come too far forward: When you squat down, your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror. Your knees should never track out and over your toes. Not squatting deep enough: Using squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor. Knees in or out: Don't point your knees in or out when you're lowering or pushing the weight. This puts unnecessary strain on the knee joints. Looking down: As soon as you look down your back rounds, simple as that.",

      "tips": "If you struggle with squatting with a barbell then this is the best version for learning how to squat in a vertical fashion. Toe angle is highly individual - experiment to see what feels best for you. Experiment with a “false” (i.e. thumbless) grip as this helps to eliminate elbow and wrist issues in some folks. Drive through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Imagine you’re trying to drop your back pockets straight towards your heels. Down, not back. Some forward translation of the knees over the toes is alright provided that the knees don’t deviate excessively inward or outward. Those with longer femurs will have to allow their knees to come farther forward if they want to remain upright. Neck position is highly individual as well - some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking straight ahead. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your anatomy. Don’t push the knees out excessively but ensure they track roughly over or slightly outside the 2nd toe.",

If the knee is positioned too far in front or behind the axis of rotation, there will be excessive stress added to the joint which could cause significant injury. Typically extensions should not be done excessively heavy due to the lack of hamstring co-contraction with the quads. When one occurs in isolation it could present an injury risk to the knee if done with excessive weight. Pointing the toes can help to enhance mind muscle connection.",

      "description": "The dumbbell lateral raise is a good exercise for building width in your upper body which gives you the 'V' shape. Grab a set of dumbbells and stand straight up with the dumbbells at your sides. Your palms should be facing your body. You should be holding the dumbbells slightly off your body, as this keeps the tension on the side delts. This is your starting position for the exercise. To execute, slowly raise the dumbbells up to around shoulder height. It's important that you do not let your wrists go above your elbows while raising the weight, as this will take the work off the side delts and put it on the front delts. Pause at the top of the movement, and then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Do not let the dumbbells touch your body, and then raise them for the next rep.",
      "tips": "The dumbbell lateral raise is one of those exercises that so many people do incorrectly. First, this is an isolation exercise, so you should be focusing on stretch and muscle contraction, not using heavy weights. Second, you MUST keep your rep timing slow and controlled. So many people use momentum to swing heavy weights up, and this is not going to get you the best results from the dumbbell lateral raise. Third, it very important that your elbows stay above your wrists. If your wrists come up too far, the focus comes off your side delts and onto your front delts. A good trick to ensure this does not happen is to tilt the dumbbells down as if you were pouring a jug of water as you raise them up. This makes it very hard to raise the wrists higher than the elbows. And finally, keep the side delts under stress for the whole set by not allowing the dumbbells to touch your body or 'hang' at the bottom of the movement.",

If your shoulders are bothering you during the movement, consider experimenting with a wider grip or utilizing some of the vertical pressing progressions listed on the site.

If you can’t hinge to 90 degrees, then hinge as far as comfortably possible while completing the exercise. Or, you could also take a seated position to complete the exercise as well. If you experience shoulder pain during the movement then it may be beneficial to rotate the dumbbells until the thumbs are pointing away from one another and the palms are facing forward. This is also known as a supinated grip and will externally rotate the shoulder. Don’t jut your head forward during the movement - this about stimulation for a small muscle group.

Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back. Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off. Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows. Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest. Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
      "tips": "Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured. Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb. If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top. The elbows will be tucked more than a normal bench due to the decrease grip width but if you experience shoulder pain during this variation you may have to slightly tweak grip width and elbow tuck to provide more space within the shoulder capsule. Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury. The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands. As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path. Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first. Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling. Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses. Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability. Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production. Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press. The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum. Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you. Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift. Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back. Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis. Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder. The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.",
